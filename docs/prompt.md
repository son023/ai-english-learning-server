Feedback on Pronunciation Errors and Improvement Strategies 🌟

Introduction:
Hello! Great effort on your journey to mastering {learner_l2} pronunciation. This feedback is designed to help you refine your skills and embrace the nuances of {learner_l2}, especially focusing on the challenges posed by your native language, {learner_l1}.

Error Analysis:
1. Confusion between /ɹɛkəɡnaɪz/ and /ɹɛk/:
   - Error: You substituted the complex consonant cluster /ɡn/ in "recognize" with a simpler /k/ sound in "wreck."
   - Possible Cause: The /ɡn/ cluster might be challenging due to its rarity in {learner_l1}.

2. Mispronunciation of /spiːtʃ/ as /biːtʃ/:
   - Error: You articulated the initial consonant sound incorrectly, substituting /sp/ with /b/.
   - Possible Cause: The /sp/ cluster may be particularly challenging as it does not commonly occur in {learner_l1} phonetic patterns.

Corrective Actions:
1. For /ɹɛkəɡnaɪz/ vs. /ɹɛk/:
   - Practice slowly pronouncing /ɡn/ in isolation, then gradually in the word "recognize."
   - Record yourself and compare with native speakers using online pronunciation tools like Forvo.

2. For /spiːtʃ/ vs. /biːtʃ/:
   - Focus on differentiating /s/ and /b/ sounds. Begin by pronouncing /s/ and /b/ separately, then in simple words, and finally in the target phrase.
   - Engage in minimal pairs exercises, practicing pairs of words that differ only in the initial sound (e.g., "spit" vs. "bit").
